# Signal Desktop Retouched

This is a fork of the original Signal Desktop app which intends to provide a better and more modern user-interface. The original readme file is listed below. Note that the installation is **different**.

## Changes
A picture is worth a thousand words:
|    |  New | Old |
| ---| ---- | ---|
| UI |![New User Interface](images/github/screenshot.png)|![Old User Interface](images/github/screenshot_old.png)|
| Animations | ![New animations](images/github/demo_retouched.gif) |![Old animations](images/github/demo_old.gif)|

But if you prefer words, here is a non-complete list of changes:
* Added [background image](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/seamless-pattern-kids-cosmonaut-5916873/)
* Increased header size
* Improved conversation view (messages are grouped by author)
* Animations for most popups
* Improved search consistency
* Color updates
* Delimiter in conversation list
* Updated scroll down button
* Properly centered avatars in search results
* Updated font size in avatars to align with mobile versions
* And a lot of tiny tweaks!


## Installation
### Binaries
The [release page](https://github.com/n-gao/Signal-Desktop-Retouched/releases) contains binaries for Windows. Since, I am solely using this client on Windows. If you are interested in other operating systems you have to building it [from source](#from-source).
### From source
To build it from source please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Drawbacks
Since this is not the official Signal client there are a number of compromises you have to deal with if you want to use this.
* Auto update is not available as it would override all changes to the default client
* You have to trust me that I know what I am doing


# Signal Desktop (original)

Signal Desktop is an Electron application that links with Signal
on [Android](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android)
or [iOS](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS).

## Install the production version: https://signal.org/download/

## Install the beta

You can install the beta version of Signal Desktop alongside the production version. The beta uses different data and install locations.

- _Windows:_ First, download [this file](https://updates.signal.org/desktop/beta.yml) and look for the `url` property that specifies the location for the latest beta installer. Download the installer by constructing a final URL that looks like this: `https://updates.signal.org/desktop/<installer location>`. Then run the installer.
- _macOS:_ First, download [this file](https://updates.signal.org/desktop/beta-mac.yml) and look for the `url` property that specifies the location for the latest beta installer. Download the installer by constructing a final URL that looks like this: `https://updates.signal.org/desktop/<package location>`. Then unzip that package and copy the `.app` file into the `/Applications` folder using Finder.
- _Linux:_ Follow the production instructions to set up the APT repository and run `apt install signal-desktop-beta`.
